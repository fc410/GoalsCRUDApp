# Goals REST API
For this project I have created a REST API for a goals app using Node.js where the user can sign up and login being authenticated using Jason Web Tokens so only they can access the goals they created and edit, delete or create new goals. All data was stored in a database using MongoDB. In the future I will be coming back and creating the front-end for this app using React.js
